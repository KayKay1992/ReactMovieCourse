Optimizing the search functionality using debouncing.

In this code, **debouncing** is used to optimize the search functionality by preventing excessive API calls while the user types in the search input.

Let's break it down step by step to explain how debouncing works in this example:

### 1. **Debouncing in Context**:
   - **Debouncing** is a technique where you delay a function (in this case, the search query) from being executed until after a specified amount of time has passed since the last time it was invoked. This helps to avoid making an API request for every single keystroke.
   
### 2. **The `useDebounce` Hook**:
   - `useDebounce` is a custom hook from the `react-use` library. Itâ€™s used to delay or debounce changes to a value before executing a function.
   - In this code, the `useDebounce` hook is used to delay the setting of the actual search term (`debounceSearchTerm`) until the user stops typing for 500 milliseconds.

### 3. **How it Works in the Code**:
   ```js
   // Debounce search term to prevent unnecessary API calls
   const [debounceSearchTerm, setDebounceSearchTerm] = useState('');
   
   // useDebounce waits 500ms after the user stops typing to update the debounceSearchTerm
   useDebounce(() => setDebounceSearchTerm(searchTerm), 500, [searchTerm]);
   ```
   - The **`useDebounce`** hook is watching the `searchTerm` state. Every time `searchTerm` changes (as the user types), `useDebounce` waits for 500 milliseconds (half a second) before calling the function inside it (`setDebounceSearchTerm`).
   - This ensures that the search term will only update after the user stops typing for 500ms. This prevents unnecessary API calls on every keystroke.

### 4. **Why Use Debouncing?**:
   - Without debouncing, every character typed would trigger an API call (which can be very inefficient, especially when querying an external API like The Movie Database API). This would slow down the app and potentially lead to rate-limiting issues from the API if too many requests are sent in a short time.
   - By debouncing, the app waits for the user to stop typing before sending the request. This results in fewer, more relevant requests and a faster, more responsive user experience.

### 5. **Fetching Movies Based on Debounced Search Term**:
   - When the `debounceSearchTerm` state changes (which is updated after the debounce period), the `useEffect` hook is triggered:
   ```js
   useEffect(() => {
     fetchMovies(debounceSearchTerm);
   }, [debounceSearchTerm]);
   ```
   - This will call the `fetchMovies` function only when the debounced search term (`debounceSearchTerm`) changes. The `fetchMovies` function fetches data from the API using the debounced search term, which ensures that the API request is sent only after the user has stopped typing for a while.

### 6. **What Happens on Typing**:
   - As the user types into the search bar (`Search` component), the `searchTerm` state is updated immediately.
   - The `useDebounce` hook waits for 500ms after the last change to the `searchTerm` before setting the `debounceSearchTerm` state.
   - The `useEffect` hook then triggers and calls the `fetchMovies` function with the new debounced value.

### 7. **API Call Optimization**:
   - **Without debouncing**, every change in `searchTerm` would result in a new API request. This can lead to slow performance or excessive API usage.
   - **With debouncing**, only after the user stops typing for 500ms will the API request be sent. This significantly reduces the number of requests made during the typing process and improves the performance of the application.

### 8. **Result**:
   - The user can type their search query without triggering an API call for every keystroke, leading to fewer requests and a smoother user experience.

### Summary:
- **Debouncing** ensures that only **one API call** is made after the user has stopped typing for **500ms**. This optimization avoids unnecessary requests and enhances the performance of the app, especially when interacting with APIs like The Movie Database API.
