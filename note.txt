Our first Component.
writing our first state and passing it as prop.

Let's break down the two key concepts you're asking about: searchTerm state and passing state as props.

1. searchTerm state:
In the App component, you are using React's useState hook to create a state variable called searchTerm:

jsx
Copy
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
searchTerm is the state variable that holds the value of the search term (initially set to an empty string '').

setSearchTerm is the function that will be used to update the searchTerm state.

How does this work?

The searchTerm state is used to store whatever the user is typing into a search input field (e.g., a text box). Initially, it is set to an empty string, but it will update every time the user changes the search term (e.g., by typing in a search field).

setSearchTerm is used to update the value of searchTerm whenever the user interacts with the search input.

2. Passing state as props:
In the App component, you are passing the searchTerm state and the setSearchTerm function as props to the Search component:

jsx
Copy
<Search searchTerm={searchTerm} setSearchTerm={setSearchTerm}/>
Here, searchTerm is being passed to the Search component so it can access the current value of the search term.

setSearchTerm is also being passed as a prop to allow the Search component to update the searchTerm state when the user types in a search field.


Key Concepts:
State (searchTerm): In the App component, searchTerm holds the current value of the search input field.

Passing state as props: The searchTerm and setSearchTerm are passed down to the Search component, allowing the Search component to display the current value of searchTerm and modify it when the user types.

Prop-drilling: By passing searchTerm and setSearchTerm to the Search component as props, the App component is making these values available to the Search component.

Flow of data:
App component:

The App component creates the searchTerm state using useState.

The searchTerm and setSearchTerm are passed as props to the Search component.

Search component:

The Search component uses the searchTerm prop to bind the value of the search input field.

It also uses setSearchTerm to update the searchTerm state in the App component whenever the user types in the input field.

This is a common pattern in React, where a parent component (like App) manages the state, and child components (like Search) interact with the state through props to either display it or update it.
