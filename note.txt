useMemo

To implement useMemo in the provided code, we can use it to memoize expensive calculations or values that don't need to be recalculated on every render unless their dependencies change. In this case, let's assume that the calculation of whether a movie is "cool" (based on ratings and isCool) is an expensive operation. We'll use useMemo to memoize this value, so it only recalculates when either ratings or isCool changes.

Breakdown of Changes:
Using useMemo:

I used the useMemo hook to memoize the movieStatus calculation.

The status is calculated based on ratings and isCool. If ratings are 4 or more and isCool is true, the movie is considered "Cool". Otherwise, it's considered "Not Cool".

The movieStatus is recalculated only when the ratings or isCool props change.

jsx
Copy
const movieStatus = useMemo(() => {
  return ratings >= 4 && isCool ? 'Cool Movie' : 'Not Cool Movie';
}, [ratings, isCool]);
Effect of useMemo:

useMemo ensures that the movieStatus value is recalculated only when either ratings or isCool changes, thus preventing unnecessary recalculations on every render.

This can be especially beneficial if the logic for determining whether a movie is cool is more complex or if there are performance concerns.

Rendering movieStatus:

I rendered movieStatus inside the Card component, which displays the computed status (either "Cool Movie" or "Not Cool Movie") based on the values of ratings and isCool.

When to Use useMemo:
useMemo is useful when you have expensive calculations or operations inside the component that don't need to run on every render.

In this case, useMemo ensures that the "coolness" calculation happens only when necessary (i.e., when ratings or isCool changes), improving performance in cases with more complex logic or larger datasets.

Example Use Cases for useMemo:
Expensive calculations that depend on specific props or state values.

Memoizing arrays or objects to prevent unnecessary re-renders when passed as dependencies to other components or hooks.
