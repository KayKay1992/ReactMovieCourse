Creating a movie card component

The code you've provided defines a MovieCard functional component in React. This component is responsible for rendering a movie card with details like the movie's title, rating, poster, release date, and original language. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this component works:

1. Props Destructuring:
The component receives a movie object as a prop. The destructuring syntax allows you to directly extract specific properties from the movie object:

javascript
Copy
const MovieCard = ({ movie: { title, vote_average, poster_path, release_date, original_language } }) => {
This means that the MovieCard component expects a movie prop and destructures it into individual properties:

title: The movie's title.

vote_average: The average rating of the movie.

poster_path: The URL path to the movie's poster image.

release_date: The release date of the movie.

original_language: The language in which the movie was originally released.

2. Rendering the Movie Card:
The component returns JSX to render the movie details. Let’s go through each part:

jsx
Copy
<div className='movie-card'>
This is the root element for the movie card. It has a className of movie-card, which is where the styling for the movie card will be applied.

Poster Image:
jsx
Copy
<img src={poster_path ? `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${poster_path}` : `/no-movie.png`} alt={title}/>
This img tag renders the movie poster.

It uses a ternary operator to check if poster_path exists. If it does, the image source will be a URL constructed with the base URL for images from the API (https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/) followed by the poster_path of the movie.

If poster_path does not exist (for example, when no poster is available for the movie), it falls back to a local image (/no-movie.png), which serves as a placeholder image when no poster is found.

Movie Title:
jsx
Copy
<h3>{title}</h3>
This renders the movie’s title inside an <h3> tag.

Movie Details (Rating, Language, Year):
Below the title, the component renders more details about the movie, such as the rating, language, and release year.

jsx
Copy
<div className="content">
  <div className="rating">
    <img src={start_Icon} alt='Star Icon'/>
    <p>{vote_average ? vote_average.toFixed(1): 'N/A'}</p>
  </div>
  <span>•</span>
  <p className='lang'>{original_language}</p>
  <span>•</span>
  <p className="year">
    {release_date ? new Date(release_date).getFullYear() : 'N/A'}
  </p>
</div>
Rating:

The rating section displays the movie’s average vote (vote_average).

The img tag renders a star icon (imported as start_Icon) to represent the rating visually.

The p tag displays the vote_average, formatted to one decimal place using .toFixed(1). If vote_average is unavailable, it displays 'N/A'.

Language:

A span separates each piece of information, and the p tag with class lang displays the movie's original language (e.g., "en" for English).

If the original_language is missing, the value will just display as 'N/A'.

Release Year:

The p tag with class year displays the year of the movie's release.

The release_date is converted to a Date object, and the .getFullYear() method is used to extract the year.

If no release date is available, it will display 'N/A'.

3. Fallback Mechanism for Missing Data:
The ternary operators throughout the component are used as fallback mechanisms. For example:

If poster_path is not available, the fallback image /no-movie.png will be shown.

If vote_average is unavailable, 'N/A' will be shown in place of the rating.

If release_date is not present, 'N/A' will be displayed for the year.

Full Code Example:
jsx
Copy
import React from 'react';
import start_Icon from '../assets/star.svg'; // Star icon for rating

const MovieCard = ({ movie: { title, vote_average, poster_path, release_date, original_language } }) => {
  return (
    <div className='movie-card'>
      <img 
        src={poster_path ? `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${poster_path}` : `/no-movie.png`} 
        alt={title}
      />
      <div className='mt-4'>
        <h3>{title}</h3>
        <div className="content">
          <div className="rating">
            <img src={start_Icon} alt='Star Icon' />
            <p>{vote_average ? vote_average.toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}</p>
          </div>
          <span>•</span>
          <p className='lang'>{original_language}</p>
          <span>•</span>
          <p className="year">
            {release_date ? new Date(release_date).getFullYear() : 'N/A'}
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MovieCard;
Summary:
Dynamic Data Rendering: The MovieCard component dynamically renders movie details such as the title, rating, language, poster, and release year, based on the data passed to it as props.

Fallbacks: The component gracefully handles missing data by providing fallback values like 'N/A' or placeholder images.

Styling: You can apply custom CSS classes (movie-card, content, rating, etc.) to style the elements in the card. Make sure to define these styles in your CSS files.
