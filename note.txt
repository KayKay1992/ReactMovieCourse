useCallback
To implement the useCallback hook in this code, we will use it to memoize the functions handleCount and handleLike. This will prevent these functions from being re-created on every render unless their dependencies change. This can be useful if these functions are passed down as props to child components, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

In the example below, we will use useCallback to memoize both handleCount and handleLike functions.

Key Changes:
Using useCallback for handleCount and handleLike:

The useCallback hook is used to memoize the functions handleCount and handleLike. By doing so, these functions will only be re-created when their dependencies change. Since these functions don’t depend on any external variables, we pass an empty dependency array [].

jsx
Copy
const handleCount = useCallback(() => {
  dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
}, []);

const handleLike = useCallback(() => {
  dispatch({ type: 'toggleLike' });
}, []);
handleCount and handleLike will now not be redefined on every render, and React will reuse the existing function unless their dependencies change. In this case, no dependencies are required, so the functions are memoized once.

Why Use useCallback:

useCallback is useful when you pass functions to child components as props, or if you want to prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions when they don’t need to be changed. If a function is passed down to a child component and doesn’t change frequently, useCallback ensures that the child doesn’t get re-rendered unnecessarily.

In this case, even though handleCount and handleLike are not passed down to child components, it's a good practice to memoize them in scenarios where the functions might be passed down or used in optimization strategies like React.memo or useEffect dependencies.

Example Use Case for useCallback:
If the Card component were to receive the handleCount and handleLike functions as props (from a parent component), useCallback would prevent those functions from being re-created on each render, which could improve performance especially if the Card component were part of a large list of components.

When to Use useCallback:
Passing functions down to child components: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of child components.

Expensive callbacks: Memoizes functions to avoid re-computation if the function logic is complex or used in optimization hooks like useEffect or React.memo.
