useRef

To implement the useRef hook in your code, I'll add an example where useRef can be used to reference and interact with DOM elements in the Card component. A common use case for useRef is to access DOM elements directly, such as focusing on an input, measuring the size of an element, or in this case, highlighting the card when it's clicked.

In this modified example, we'll use useRef to highlight the Card component when it's clicked by changing the background color.

Key Changes:
Using useRef:

I created a reference to the Card DOM element with the line:

jsx
Copy
const cardRef = useRef(null);
This cardRef is used to directly access the DOM node of the Card component.

Attaching the ref to the DOM element:

The ref is passed to the div element representing the card:

jsx
Copy
<div ref={cardRef} className={`card-cointainer ${theme}`} onClick={handleCardClick}>
This allows us to interact with this DOM element via the cardRef.

Handling Card Click to Highlight:

When the card is clicked, the handleCardClick function is triggered. It checks the current background color of the Card and toggles it to lightyellow when clicked, and resets it if itâ€™s already highlighted:

jsx
Copy
const handleCardClick = () => {
  if (cardRef.current) {
    cardRef.current.style.backgroundColor = cardRef.current.style.backgroundColor === 'lightyellow' ? '' : 'lightyellow';
  }
  handleCount();
};
What This Does:
When you click on a Card, the background color will toggle between lightyellow and its original color, highlighting the card.

The useRef hook allows you to interact with the Card's DOM element without needing to use state to store the background color.

Example Use Cases for useRef:
Managing focus on an input field.

Animating or measuring DOM elements directly.

Avoiding re-renders by accessing DOM elements or mutable values directly.

In this case, useRef is used to directly manipulate the DOM to highlight the card when it's clicked.
