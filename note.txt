Now lets Show the Trending list of movies using appwrite.

we need to create another appwrite function to be able to fetch top movies from database. thiss is done in appwrite.js.

explaining the movie trending function in app.js.

In this code, the **trending movie fetching functionality** is implemented in the `fetchTrendingMovies` function. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

### 1. **State to Store Trending Movies**

```javascript
const [trendingMovies, setTrendingMovies] = useState([]);
```

- `trendingMovies`: This state variable holds the list of trending movies that will be fetched and displayed on the page.

### 2. **Fetching Trending Movies**

```javascript
const fetchTrendingMovies = async () => {
  try {
    const movies = await getTrendingMovies(); // Fetch trending movies from Appwrite
    setTrendingMovies(movies); // Store the fetched trending movies in the state
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching trending movies: ${error}`); // Log any error
  } 
};
```

- The `fetchTrendingMovies` function is an **asynchronous function** that calls `getTrendingMovies()` to fetch the list of trending movies.
- It then updates the `trendingMovies` state with the movies retrieved from `getTrendingMovies()`.
- In case of an error (e.g., a network issue), it logs the error message to the console.

### 3. **`getTrendingMovies()` Function**

The `getTrendingMovies()` function is imported from `appwrite`. It likely interacts with the Appwrite database or another API to get a list of trending movies. The implementation of `getTrendingMovies()` isn't shown in the code you provided, but it's assumed to be a function that fetches the data from Appwrite or a similar backend service.

```javascript
import { getTrendingMovies } from "./appwrite";
```

### 4. **Triggering the Trending Movie Fetching**

The `fetchTrendingMovies` function is called in the `useEffect` hook when the component first mounts:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchTrendingMovies(); // Fetch trending movies on component mount
}, []);
```

- This `useEffect` hook is executed only once when the component mounts (because the dependency array is empty `[]`).
- It triggers the `fetchTrendingMovies` function to fetch the trending movies and populate the `trendingMovies` state.

### 5. **Rendering the Trending Movies**

The code below renders the trending movies in the UI:

```javascript
{trendingMovies.length > 0 && (
  <section className="trending">
    <h2>Trending Movies</h2>
    <ul>
      {trendingMovies.map((movie, index) => (
        <li key={movie.id}>
          <p>{index + 1}</p>
          <img
            src={movie.poster_url}
            alt={movie.title}
          />
          <h3>{movie.title}</h3>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </section>
)}
```

- This checks if there are any `trendingMovies` in the state (i.e., `trendingMovies.length > 0`).
- If there are trending movies, it renders them in a `section` with a heading "Trending Movies."
- It maps over the `trendingMovies` array and renders each movie's position (`index + 1`), poster image (`movie.poster_url`), and title (`movie.title`).
  
The result is that the app will display a list of trending movies fetched when the component mounts. Each movie will have its poster, title, and rank based on its position in the array (e.g., "1", "2", "3", etc.).

### 6. **Summary of Trending Movies Fetching Flow**

- **Initial Load:** When the app first loads, the `useEffect` hook fetches the trending movies by calling `fetchTrendingMovies()`.
- **Fetching:** `fetchTrendingMovies` uses the `getTrendingMovies()` function to fetch the list of trending movies.
- **State Update:** Once the movies are fetched, the `trendingMovies` state is updated, and the UI re-renders to display the list of trending movies.
- **Error Handling:** If an error occurs while fetching the movies, it is logged in the console.

### 7. **Other Relevant Parts of the Code**

- **Debounced Search Term:** There's another `useEffect` that triggers the movie fetch (`fetchMovies`) whenever the user changes the search term. This is unrelated to the trending movies, but it's important for fetching movies based on user search input.
  
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchMovies(debounceSearchTerm); // Fetch movies based on the debounced search term
}, [debounceSearchTerm]); 
```

### Conclusion

In summary, the trending movies functionality is handled by the `fetchTrendingMovies` function, which calls `getTrendingMovies` to retrieve a list of trending movies and updates the `trendingMovies` state. The `useEffect` hook ensures that the trending movies are fetched when the component mounts, and they are rendered in a dedicated section of the UI.

EXPLAINING THE GETTRENDING MOVIES FUNCTINON IN APPWRITE.JS.

In the code you provided, the `getTrendingMovies` function is designed to fetch the trending movies from a database (likely Appwrite in this case). Let's break it down and explain the implementation:

### 1. **Function Declaration**

```javascript
export const getTrendingMovies = async () => {
```

- This function is an **asynchronous function** (indicated by `async`), meaning it will return a promise, and you can use `await` inside it to wait for asynchronous operations to complete.

### 2. **Fetching Data from Appwrite Database**

```javascript
const results = await database.listDocuments(DATABASE_ID, COLLECTION_ID, [
  Query.limit(10),
  Query.orderDesc('count'),
]);
```

- **`database.listDocuments(DATABASE_ID, COLLECTION_ID, [...])`**:
  - This line calls the `listDocuments` method from the **Appwrite SDK** to query documents in a specific collection of a database.
  - `DATABASE_ID` and `COLLECTION_ID` are variables representing the IDs of the database and collection you're querying in the Appwrite service.
  
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `Query.limit(10)`: Limits the number of documents returned to 10. This is useful for fetching a small subset of results, which are the top 10 trending movies in this case.
  - `Query.orderDesc('count')`: Orders the documents in descending order based on the `count` field. This assumes that you have a field `count` in your documents that tracks how many times a movie has been searched for (or viewed, depending on your use case). This allows you to fetch the most popular or trending movies.

### 3. **Returning the Results**

```javascript
return results.documents;
```

- After executing the query, the result is stored in the `results` object. The `results.documents` contains the documents returned from the database. This array is then returned by the `getTrendingMovies` function.
  
  - Each item in `results.documents` represents a movie document, which would contain fields such as `id`, `title`, `count`, `poster_url`, etc. These fields would be used later in the application (as seen in the component where you're rendering the trending movies).

### 4. **Error Handling**

```javascript
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

- **Error handling**: If there's any error during the execution of the database query (e.g., network issue, wrong database ID, etc.), the error will be caught and logged to the console.
  
### Summary of `getTrendingMovies`

- The function fetches the top 10 trending movies from the database, based on the `count` field in descending order.
- It uses Appwrite's `listDocuments` method to query the database and get the top 10 documents.
- The results are returned as an array of movie documents, which are assumed to have properties like `id`, `title`, `count`, and `poster_url`.
- The function handles any errors that may occur during the query.

### Usage in the App

In your `App.js` file, this function is used in the `fetchTrendingMovies` function:

```javascript
const fetchTrendingMovies = async () => {
  try {
    const movies = await getTrendingMovies(); // Fetch trending movies
    setTrendingMovies(movies); // Update state with trending movies
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching trending movies: ${error}`);
  } 
};
```

- This function calls `getTrendingMovies` to fetch the top 10 trending movies from the Appwrite database and then updates the `trendingMovies` state with the returned movies. These movies are then displayed in the UI.

### Considerations

- Ensure that your Appwrite database collection contains the `count` field (or whichever field you're using to track the popularity of the movies). This is necessary for the `Query.orderDesc('count')` to work as expected.
- Make sure your Appwrite API endpoint is correctly set up with the necessary permissions to access the database and fetch documents.
